Nosso Storefront padrão é um PWA!\\n\\nCom o grande aumento de tráfego mobile no e-commerce um PWA commerce traz enormes vantagens. Veja abaixo as principais vantagens e com alguns exemplos de sucesso com estudos de caso feitos pelo Google\\n\\n**Digno de estar na tela inicial**\\n\\nQuando os critérios do Progressive Web App são atendidos, o Chrome solicita que os usuários adicionem o PWA à tela inicial. Com isso a loja se transforma em uma aplicação nativa sem a necessidade de download através de uma app store. Isso pode não funcionar perfeitamente em IOS que tem 13,57% do market share mobile brasileiro, sendo quase todo o resto dominado pelo Android.\\n\\n**Maior engajamento**\\n\\nO PWA da [eXtra Electronics](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/extra) aumentou o re-engajamento em 4X, esses usuários gastam o dobro do tempo no site.\\n Com a [OLX ](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2017/olx) o aumento do o re-engajamento foi de 250%.\\n\\n**Aumento na taxa de conversão**\\n\\nA capacidade de fornecer de um PWA melhorar a experiência
